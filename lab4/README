textVectorizer.py:
   usage: textVectorizer.py [-h] -d DIR -o OUTPUT -g GROUND -s STEM -r REMOVE -t THRESHOLD

   DIR: directory of data files (eg. data/C50/)
   OUTPUT: file to write vectorizations to (eg. vectors.txt)
   GROUND: file to write ground truth to (eg. ground_truth.txt)
   STEM: True/False to include stemming (eg. True)
   REMOVE: True/False to include stopword removal (eg. True)
   THRESHOLD: threshold used for tf-idf, 0 for no threshold (eg. 0)

stemmer.py:
   Porter Stemming Algorithm; used as module by textVectorizer.py

stopwords.txt:
   Text file containing stopwords; used for stopword removal by textVectorizer.py

knnAuthorship.py:
   usage: knnAuthorship.py [-h] -v VECTORS -g GROUND -k K  

   VECTORS: file with vectorizations (eg. vectors.txt)
   GROUND: file with ground truth (eg. ground_truth.txt)
   K: k value used for KNN   

   Writes predictions to stdout; can be piped to file

classifierEvaluation.py:
   usage: classifierEvaluation.py [-h] -p PRED -g GROUND

   PRED: file with predictions (eg. k5_preds.txt)
   GROUND: file with ground truth (eg. ground_truth.txt)

   Writes statistics(including confusion matrix) to stdout; can be piped to file

   Output file submitted with statistics: k5eval.out

clusteringAuthorship.py:
   python clusteringAuthorship.py 
      -f1 <file with doc name, author> 
      -f2 <file with tf_idf vectors for each document>
      -t threshold
      -o output text file for json tree
      -b True for verbose output (centroid stats)/ False for no output to console
